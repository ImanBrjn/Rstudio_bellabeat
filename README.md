A Goolge Data Analytics Case Study

## Introduction
In this case study, I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com), a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I performed a real-world task as a junior data analyst. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but it has the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder, and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide the marketing strategy for the company.


## About the Company
Bellabeat was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen utilized her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women worldwide. By collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, Bellabeat empowers women with knowledge about their health and habits. Since its establishment in 2013, Bellabeat has experienced rapid growth, positioning itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices globally and introduced multiple products. These products became available through an increasing number of online retailers, alongside their own e-commerce channel on their website. While the company has invested in traditional advertising media like radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, it predominantly focuses on extensive digital marketing.

## Analysis
To address the key business questions, I adhered to the steps of the data analysis process: asking, preparing, processing, analyzing, sharing, and acting.
